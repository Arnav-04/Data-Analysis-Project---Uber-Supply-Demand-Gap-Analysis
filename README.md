# Uber Suppy Demand Gap Analysis

In this project, you’ll address Uber's challenges with driver cancellations and non-availability of cars, which impact revenue. 

Using a masked dataset similar to those handled by Uber data analysts, you’ll apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques to systematically solve these issues. 

Understanding these problems is crucial, as driver cancellations and car shortages directly affect Uber’s business operations and revenue.
